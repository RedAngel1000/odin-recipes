            Chocolate chip cookies are a baking staple! Everyone knows them, everyone loves them, and now, you'll know how to make them!
        </h3>
        <p>
            A family recipe made by my grandma, these cookies are soft and chewy on the inside, while still being crispy on the outside. The melty chocolate chips and warm cookie pairs perfectly with a nice glass of cold milk!
